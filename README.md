# SyntaxVariables

I'm creating repo for practicing python syntax and variables while learning programming as a Data Analyst through CodeAcademy.com

Hopefully, if the learning is going correctly this will be shit and full of mistakes

The project involved in this phase of the analyst path "Medical Insurance", will be created in separate repo.
And I pray that that one is without mistakes.

Thank you
